# Morphometric_Similarity_SZ

This repo contains code to analyse morphometric similarity matrices from patients with schizophrenia and healthy control subjects, as reported in... Please cite that paper if you find this code helpful in your own analyses. The PLS code to relate gene expression to the neuroimaging signal was written by Dr Petra Vértes and introduced in [Whitaker and Vértes, PNAS 2016](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/32/9105), please cite that paper if you this approach in your own work.

The code is written in [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). Data to go with the code can be downloaded at... The code is split into two files- 'MS_analyses.md' contains the code needed to construct the morphometric similarity matrices and analyse the global and regional differences in MS between control subjects and patients, whilst 'Gene_analyses.md' contains the code needed for the gene analyses (building on inputs from 'MS_analyses.md').
